I am a [computer science] [cse] PhD student at the [University of Washington] [uw].
I am part of the [sampa group] [sampa] and am advised by [Mark Oskin] [oskin].


I am interested in understanding and improving the performance of complex architectures.
Another one of my research interests is making complex architectures easier to program while maintaining high performance.
I have worked on code generation targetting various parallel architectures and have created methodologies and built tools to better understand the behavior and performance of GPUs. 

Before grad school, I studied [computer science] [cs@csb] and [math] [math@csv] at [the College of Saint Benedict] [csb].
