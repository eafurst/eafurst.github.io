I am a Member of Technical Staff at [AMD Research][amd].
I received my PhD in [computer science] [cse] at the [University of Washington] [uw].
At UW, I was part of the [architecture group] [sampa] and was advised by [Mark Oskin] [oskin].

I am interested in understanding and improving the performance of complex architectures.
During graduate school, I focused on making complex architectures easier to program while maintaining high performance.
I have worked on code generation targetting various parallel architectures and have created methodologies and built tools to better understand the behavior and performance of GPUs. 
My thesis work focused on generating code for graph applications on a manycore architecture that utilizes high bandwidth memory.
