**I am looking for industry positions starting in Fall 2021! Feel free to contact me at [eafurst@cs.washington.edu] [email]**

I am a [computer science] [cse] PhD candidate at the [University of Washington] [uw].
I am part of the [sampa group] [sampa] and am advised by [Mark Oskin] [oskin].

I am interested in understanding and improving the performance of complex architectures.
My current research focuses on making complex architectures easier to program while maintaining high performance.
I have worked on code generation targetting various parallel architectures and have created methodologies and built tools to better understand the behavior and performance of GPUs. 
I am currently working on generating code for graph applications on a manycore architecture that utilizes high bandwidth memory.
